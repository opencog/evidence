Evidence
========
A primary intellectual activity is the gathering of evidence to
determine the nature and structure of things. It is closely related to
the task of discrerning similarity, and of reasoning by analogy.
This git repo is a rumination of these tasks, plus an attempt to express
these ideas as functional code, expressed as OpenCog [Atomese](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atomese).

Overview
--------
The process of evidence-gathering and stitching together a story is
used everywhere in human undertakings: examples include journalism, to
put together a news story; jury trials, to determine guilt or innocence;
scientific investigation, to understand the structure of nature.

An example from biology is whole-genome sequencing: stitching
together snippets of genetic sequences, obtained from PCR, into a whole.
Unlike journalism, jury trials or scientific investigation, genome
sequencing can be machine-automated. It is, however, extremely domain
specific: it can only be used for genetics. It is not extensible to
other domains.

The goal of the present project is to explore the foundations of
evidence gathering and the weaving together of (coherent) stories,
and to expose this foundation so that it is amenable to algorithmic
processing. To describe the process of construction sufficiently well,
that it can be applied to arbitrary domains and situations. And not just
philosophically or mathematically, but expressed as software that can
actually do "useful things" that "people want".

The project here is a mash-up of theory and experiment, of philosophy
math and code. The terminology will bounce between abstract concepts and
low-level code. Apologies in advance if it veers off into the opaque.
The topic is difficult.

Genealogy
---------
A concrete example is in order, one that sits part-way between
abstraction and algorithmic directness.
