Evidence
========
A primary intellectual activity is the gathering of evidence to
determine the nature and structure of things. It is closely related to
the task of discrerning similarity, and of reasoni9ng by analogy.
This git repo is a rumination of these tasks, plus an attempt to express
these ideas as functional code, expressed as OpenCog [Atomese](https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Atomese).
